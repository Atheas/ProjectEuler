**Hello**

This is my journey to attempt to solve problems solved on https://projecteuler.net/ 

For whatever reason you're looking through my code, this will help you learn about my file naming better. 

First three digits are the numbers associated with the corresponding Euler problem. For example, "001 - m.py" means it's my solution to the first problem listed on the Euler website. 

The letters or numbers after the dash signals whether it's my main solution or other solution or alternative solution. Basically, main solution is what I would implement more than the others. 

M stands for main solution | ma stands for alternative solution | o stands for other solution 

You might find numbers after the letters, e.g. "001 - o1.py" that just helps to separate out different versions of the solution. Some of it may not work or incomplete but main solution should always work.
